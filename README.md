# Considerations

This project was done using Google Colab so it is recommended to upload the repository to Google drive and execute the notebook from Google Colab. That being said, feel free to download the data and use the code however you wish.

# anomaly-detection

The main objective of this notebook is to detect anomalies or outliers using 3 different approaches:

- Interquartile Range (Statistic mean) Rango Intercuartil (medida estad√≠stica)
- K-Means Clustering
- Isolation Forest

As context, we use data from a water pump system with 52 sensors that collect information every minute. For reference, each sensor has more than 220.000 collected values (measurements).
